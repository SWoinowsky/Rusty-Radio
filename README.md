# Rusty-Radio
Terminal-Based Spotify Radio application for linux devices where a web player is too intensive.

# Why?
When I was in highschool, I was absolutely enthralled by small computer systems like the Raspberry Pi, Latte Panda, and NextThingCo's (Rest in peace) CHIP. There was, at one point, a terminal app that connected to Pandora and I loved having such a lightweight way to interact with the service. Since I found that a missing spot in my life, I decided I'd try my hand at making my own. 

# What's to see here?
I'll be documenting what I do, what I find, and how I take steps to learning to do this project as a notebook for myself and a roadmap for people interested in making their own.

## Learning TUI
Here I'll be following [This Tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/rust-and-tui-building-a-command-line-interface-in-rust/) by a Mario Zupan. The summarized goal is to figure out how to use TUI the TUI framework with Crossterm running everything behind-the-scenes.
